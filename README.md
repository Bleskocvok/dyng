## FAQ

### What was the motivation for creating this library?
This library is the outcome of my bachelor's thesis, which can be accessed [here](https://is.muni.cz/auth/th/ro22a/). (It's written in the Czech language.)

### What algorithms are used?

The library currently used a combination of these two algorithms:

- **Foresighted Layout with Tolerance**
Diehl S., GÃ¶rg C. (2002) Graphs, They Are Changing. In: Goodrich M.T., Kobourov S.G. (eds) Graph Drawing. GD 2002. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 2528. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg
- **Fruchterman--Reingold**
Fruchterman, T.M., & Reingold, E.M. (1991). Graph Drawing by Force-directed Placement. Softw. Pract. Exp., 21, 1129-1164.

### Is the logo supposed to represent a flame?

Yes, it is.

### Why isn't the library named `dyngl` instead? (**DYN**amic **G**raph **L**ayout)
